			This is my HTML notes ...

			<br>
			Let's know what does <em>Markup</em> means:
			Markup is a way the browser can know how exactly it should deal with the text.
			because we don't write code in text programs like word for example, we are not able to
			formate the text for example.. by using the markup elements we can formate text ... 
			<br>
			<br>
			for example:
			if I want to write a italic title in my file and let it appear Italic on the browser; the
			only way to do that is to use the markup element em ... 
			<br>
			<br>
			The element is composed of start tag <> and an end tag </ > and a content in between.

			<br>
			<br>

			<em> This is an italic Title </em>

			<br>
			 Its skin as tough as shell
			<br>
			 And every file that toad would write
			<br>
			 It used HTML.

			<p> Once upon a time there was a baby tiger named Talia.</p>
			<p> Talia lived in a fearsome jungle in the middle of the fearsome jungle.</p>
			<p> Talia was the most fearsome of all, though she was only a baby.</p>

			In <em><strong>mathimatical equations</strong></em> we may need to write it using the sup element
			<br>
			example: 2x2=2<sup>2</sup>
			<br>
			<br>
			however; in <em><strong>chemical equations</strong></em> we may need to use the sub elements.<br>
			example: H<sub>2</sub>O

			<h1>My HTML Notes</h1>

			<p>This page is a collection of my awesome notes about HTML!</p>

			<h2>The Web</h2>

			<p>The Web (or World Wide Web) is a collection of documents and other files. Most of the documents are made using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).</p>

			<h2>What is HTML?</h2>

			<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. It's used to define the structure or layout of a web page.</p>


			<h1>My chemistry notes</h1>

			<p><strong>Molecule name:</strong><em> Sulfur hexafluoride</em></p>

			<p><strong>Molecular formula:</strong> C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub></p>

			<p><strong>Note:</strong> This gas has a much higher density than air. Basically the opposite of helium. <mark>Crazy!</mark></p>

			<h1>Here are some of the notes that I have learned</h1>
			<h2>There are some elements require closin tags</h2>
			<p>Here are some examples</p>

			<ul>
				<li> div element
				<li> ordered and unordered lists
				<li> em element
				<li> strong element
			</ul>

			<h2>There are other elements that don't require closing tag</h2>
			<p>Here are some examples</p>

			<ol>
				<li> paragraph element
				<li> list element
			</ol>

			<p>for the elements that doesn't need a closing tag, the browser knows that it has ended when you start another element</p>
			<h2> There are other elements that shouldn't have any closing tags</h2>
			<p>An example for that is the break element</p>

		<p>I can find interesting websites that would allow me to put interesting photos by searching for image placeholder websites,</p>
		<p>All what I will need to do then is to write the website url and follow it by /width/hieght</p>
